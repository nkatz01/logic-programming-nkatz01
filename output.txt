There are three reasons why I prefer jogging to other sports. 
One reason is that jogging is a cheap sport.
I can practise it anywhere at any time with no need for a ball or any other equipment. 
Another reason why I prefer jogging is that it is friendly to my heart. 
I don’t have to exhaust myself or do excessive efforts while jogging. 
Finally, I prefer this sport because it is safe. 
It isn’t as risky as other sports like gymnastics, racing or horseback riding. For all these reasons, I consider jogging the best sport of all.
